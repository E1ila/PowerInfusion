# AutoTrinket
WoW 1.12 Addon - Automatic replace trinket according to cooldown remaining.

# Usage

When running the first time, write `/at add` to add the currently equipped trinkets to the list. 

The order of insertion is the reverse priority order, so start with the least important trinkets.

You can always clear your trinket list with `/at clear`.

Write `/at` for help.
